      <h2>5 Years From Now</h2>
      <p>In five years, I want to be deeply involved in AI development, 
         possibly contributing to advancements in natural language
        processing or other AI applications. Ideally, I'd like to be part of a 
        team pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, while also 
        emphasizing ethical AI use. Location-wise, being in a dynamic urban 
        environment known for innovation and technology would be ideal. 
        Country like America, Canada, or Japan come to mind, where there's a 
        vibrant tech community and plenty of collaboration opportunities.
        
        Reflecting on what I've seen in the industry, despite the stress and 
        pressure, it has been immensely rewarding. The challenges have pushed 
        me to grow and learn continuously, and the potential impact of AI across
        various fields is truly exciting.
        
        Yes, I still want to be here â€” in a field where every day brings new 
        discoveries and opportunities to make a meaningful difference.</p>
